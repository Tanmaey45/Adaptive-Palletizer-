# Adaptive Palletizing using Simulation Optimization
This repo involves approach to solve the MathWorks Challenge Project - Adaptive Palletizing with Simulation Optimization



**Abstract**

Traditional palletizing systems using teach pendants lack flexibility, making them unsuitable for handling varying box sizes or dynamic layout changes. This leads to inefficiencies, increased cycle times, and a higher risk of product damage. With rising demand for agile automation in logistics and manufacturing, there is a need for a flexible, optimized palletizing system. This project proposes the use of optimization techniques and model-based design to develop a flexible palletizing system, leveraging collaborative robots like Universal Robots, known for their ease of use and safety.

**Introduction**

To address these challenges, this project develops a flexible and intelligent palletizing solution using model-based design, trajectory optimization, and layered packing strategies. The approach leverages pre-uploaded data—such as box dimensions and weights—and generates optimized pallet layouts using MATLAB-Python integration. It enables a Universal Robot to execute deterministic, collision-free placements with minimal energy consumption. QR code integration, temporary staging platforms, and 2-layer packing strategies further enhance the system’s robustness. This project demonstrates how simulation and real-time adjustments can be combined to meet the rising demand for adaptive automation in smart manufacturing.

This project builds upon the existing MATLAB [Robot Palletizing Example](https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ug/palletize-boxes-using-cobot-with-simulink-3d-animation.html), which originally palletized boxes of fixed dimensions and spawn.

## Approach to the problem

The steps suggested in the [Github page of challenge](https://github.com/mathworks/MATLAB-Simulink-Challenge-Project-Hub/blob/main/projects/Adaptive%20Palletizing%20with%20Simulation%20Optimization/README.md) were followed, and a few were changed according to the scope of knowledge. The steps are listed down below in short. Find detailed description of each step.
